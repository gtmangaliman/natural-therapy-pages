Assumptions: Question that I would ask the Project Manager
-What would be our Base URL for this project?
-What are the list of Locations that we should include?
-What are the list of Categories that we should include?
-How few should the gallery photos be? Is it deletable?
-Will there only be one category and location per practioner?
-What are the validations we shoud consider?
-Which data should we retain once it gets deleted?

Given more time I would have done the ff:
-User access management tool for users - list of users including their permissions per module based on their role
-Logs for all the CRUD execution per user
-Error Logs
-Filter domains that can access CRUD methods.
